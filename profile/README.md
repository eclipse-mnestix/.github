Mnestix is the perfect tool to demonstrate the power and potential of AAS (Asset Administration Shells) for the implementation of standardized digital twins. It opens the way for use cases such as the Digital Product Passport (DPP).

**Think big, start small**: We believe that the more widespread the Asset Administration Shell is, the better it can realize its potential as an industry standard. Thatâ€™s why our goal is to enable as many companies as possible to get started free of charge and with a low threshold.
